# REST API for TApp
## How to use 
You need to get hamachi (xD). Probably you have to register a LogMeIn account. Network ID: `jhoysbou-server`, password: `kvfg6Q29`.
Now IPv4 address is an IP address than you can use to send requests. I prefer to use `Postman` to do it.
To send a simple requests you just need to write correct address with port `8080` and select a right type.
#### Example: 
My IPv4 is `25.41.84.109`, as you see, I use `8080` port  with `GET` request to `v1/users`.
